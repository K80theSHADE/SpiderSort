# SpiderSort
The repo for the SpiderSort utility.

SpiderSort is a slimmer version of SpiderData.
It could even be considered to be a component thereof, since SpiderData posesses all the apparent capabilities of SpiderSort.
However, because SS and SD are made for different purposes, they function in completely different ways.
They look similar; many of the GUI elements are even the same.
It should be apparent that this is a SpiderSoft product.
But that's where the similarities end.
SpiderSort is even coded in a different language because that language is best for the needs and goals of SS vs. SD.

SpiderSort and SpiderData are both freeware programs. They always have been, and they always will be.
I have done this for a very insidious reason: I want every OS builder to enfold these same indexing and file-handling capabilities INTO their software natively so people don't have to keep downing MY stuff.
I wrote these BECAUSE they were sorely needed, they should already have been there since the 20th Century, and it's dumb that they're not.
So here is the SpiderSort Utility.
It will sort and organize the contents of ALL drives and directories physically (not remotely)attached to your computer.
It will NOT sort or modify in any way any directories marked as "system," "protected," or otherwise marked as sensitive.
It can find and either sort seperately or delete entirely duplicate files over and/or under a certain size, with or without certain attributes, or made/modified within certain date ranges, or any or all or any combination of these.
It can operate with administrator rights once the user has scored highly on a small, easy quiz included in the software to unlock, "HaX0R M0De." This mode expands the capabilities of the software in the world's first, "Quiz-Upgradable License,"
"HaX0R M0De" effectively grants the program "always-on" administrator/root privileges.
*nix users please note: The r00t privileges granted to this or ANY OTHER SpiderSoft product are always based on su; as opposed to sudo. This will require the root account to have been assigned a password which will then be given to SpiderSort.
